# T2 Availability Checker
This repository is in charge of accepting or rejecting the appointment requested by the user by making sure that the desired time is not booked by any other user. This module provides the functionality to access the database and check for the selected time availability.

This platform has been developed using a [**Clean Architecture**](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and referring to **SOLID Principles**. That is, group the different classes that we were using in different folders such as Infrastructure, Application and Domain in order to keep clear the sepparation of concerns. Having these folders helped us understand where each functionality of the program was located and thus maintain a certain order in the creation of the code.

## 🛠 Pre-Requirements 
There are some technical requirements that need to be taken into consideration before having full access to the program's functionality, such as:

- Install a suitable IDE for TypeScript (recommending [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/))
- Installing [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) V14.21.2 or greater
- Installing [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) (MongoDB object-database mapper)

In order to install the **required packages** for the system to execute, make sure to run the following command:
```
npm i
```

Furthermore, this module establishes communication with others via **MQTT** via [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/) which is a standard messaging protocol. Having MQTT publish/subscribe protocol provides a scalable and reliable way to connect devices over the Internet

Some more information about the MQTT protocol can be read [here](https://www.hivemq.com/docs/hivemq/4.10/user-guide/introduction.html)

## 🚀 Getting Started 

- Would be to **clone** the repository from GitLab

HTTPS
```
https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit355/dit356-2022/t-2/T2-AvailabilityChecker.git
```

SSH
```
git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit355/dit356-2022/t-2/T2-AvailabilityChecker.git
```
- Open the project in the selected IDE

- Once the repository has been succesfully cloned in your machine and having installed all of the **dependencies** via npm. 
Open a terminal in your preferred IDE where this project has been opened in and run the following command to **execute the module** and leave it ready for communication with the others:
```
cd src/Infrastructure/Controllers/
npm run compile
node Main.js
```
